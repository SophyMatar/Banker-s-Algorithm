# Bankers Algorithm

Banker’s Algorithm for deadlock avoidance.

A system with five processes P0 through P4 and three resources of type A, B, C. 
Resource type A has 10 instances, B has 5 instances and type C has 7 instances. 

Implement the Banker’s algorithm to answer the following question：

Is the system in a safe state? Yes

Then what is the safe sequence?  P1 -> P3 -> P4 -> P0 -> P2
